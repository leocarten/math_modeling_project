    <h2>What is Bitcoin? <span style="font-size: 20px; color: #7b7c7c">True peer to peer transactions</span></h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority or government. It operates on a technology called blockchain, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">In simlper terms: When John swipes his visa vard to buy groceries, a bank is used as third party to ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;">John has enough money in his account to make the purchase.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;">John hasn't surpassed his spending limit.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;">John's transaction is recorded in the bank's centralized system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">Now, imagine John made this purchase using Bitcoin...</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;">There's no need for a central authority like a bank or government.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;">Transactions are verified by a distributed network of computers (nodes) rather than a single entity.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;">The information about the transaction is securely recorded on a blockchain, providing transparency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">At the end of the day, Bitcoin allows people like John to make digital transactions without the need for intermediaries, in a secure and transparent way. Whether you think having a distributed network to control money is a good or bad thing is up to you...</p>

<section class="container" id="blockchain">
    <h2>What is a blockchain? <span style="font-size: 20px; color: #7b7c7c">A public ledger everyone can see</span></h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">A blockchain is a collection of blocks that are chained together. Each block contains a maximum amount of transactions, in the context of Bitcoin, the maximum blocksize is 1MB, or about 2,000 transactions. Every 10 minutes or so, a new block is published onto the blockchain. Each block is published via miners. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px !important; margin-right: 25px !important; "><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><i class="fa fa-bolt" style="font-size: px; color: rgb(31, 67, 226);"></i> DID YOU KNOW</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">VISA can perform ~20,000 transactions per second, while Bitcoin can only perform about 6 transactions per second. This is a fundamental error with how the blockchain operates, since each blocksize has a maximum size of 1MB.</span></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">At the end of the day, a blockchain is just a giant ledger that contains every transactiion that has ever occured. Earlier I stated how in a centralized banking system, transactions are stored in a database. You can think of a blockchain as a distributed database that everyone has access to. To build on the example above, imagine <span class="standout">anyone</span> wanted to view John's transaction. They could. They would see that John spent $17 at 3:30pm at Market Basket. You can see an example of a Bitcoin block <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/819028" target="_blank">here</a>. If you visit this page, can can see the time the block was mined on, the amount of Bitcoin minted [brought into circulation], the total reward to the miner, etc. If you happen to scroll down, you can also view every transaction that occured inside of that block.</p>

<section class="container" id="miners">
    <h2>What role do Bitcoin miners play? <span style="font-size: 20px; color: #7b7c7c">Is it luck or skill?</span> </h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">Miners pay an integral part of maintaining blockchains. Miners need to run intense computer programs to generate hashes. Bitcoin uses adjustment algorithms that can re-correct [in real time] how many digits of a hash a miner needs to guess. A hash is a function <span class="standout">f(x)=n</span>, such that the input string <span class="standout">x</span> will always be mapped to the output string <span class="standout">n</span>. Hashes have a property such that generating a hash is simple, but reverse engineering a hash [trying to derive the value of <span class="standout">x</span> from <span class="standout">n</span>] is nearly computationally impossible.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">Imagine you are at a casino and someone hands you a dice, but not a normal dice. Instead, this dice has 10,000 sides. The rules of the game are simple: Role the dice and land on a number less than 100 to win. Statistically speaking, the odds of this are very low. But, this is exactly what Bitcoin mining is. See, Bitcoin uses a <span class='standout'>Proof of Work</span> (PoW) mechanism to create blocks. The proof in this case is how many attempts they took to guess a random string to try to generate a matching hash. Let's go back to the casino for a moment. Let's say Ricky finally roled a value less than 100 - so Ricky wins. The work that Ricky had to put into winning [rolling the dice many, many times] is similiar to how the Bitcoin miner had to consume a lot of resources [such as electricity] to generate a maching hash.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px !important; margin-right: 25px !important; "><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><i class="fa fa-bolt" style="font-size: px; color: rgb(31, 67, 226);"></i> DID YOU KNOW</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1 bitcoin transaction takes 1,449 kWh to complete, which is equivalent of approximately 50 days of power for the average US household. </span></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">Remember earlier how I said Bitcoin uses a real time self correction algorithm? It's going to all come full circle in a moment. When we are at the casino, and there are only 3 people playing the dice game, we need to roll less than a 100 on a 10,000 sided dice. This ensure there will be a lot of work put into winning the prize. Now, let's imagine there are 20,000 people playing this game. The winner is much more likely to have to put in <span class='standout'>less</span> work, right? Bitcoin is like this too - the more miners, the quicker blocks can be generated. Bitcoin can algorithmically decrease the winning value, i.e. changing the winning value of less than 100 to less than 3...</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">Once someone finally rolls a value less than 3, all 20,000 players can look down and either agree, or disagree that the value is less than 3. Similiarlly, all nodes in the distributed network can agree that the correct hash was generated. Once this is done, the transaction is stored inside of that block on the blockchain, <span class='standout'>forever</span>, and a new block is displayed for miners to do the same thing all over again.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">Miners are incentivised to play because of the rewards that come with generating the correct hash. The initial reward for mining a Bitcoin block was 50 Bitcoin. This value is halved every 210,000 blocks that get published, and on average, publishing 210,000 blocks takes approximately 4 years. So, from the initial creation of Bitcoin in 2009 to 2013, miners we rewarded 50 Bitcoin per block. From 2013 to 2017, miners were rewarded 25 Bitcoin per block, then 12.5 per block from 2017 to 2021, then 6.25 from 2021 to 2025, etc. This halving is what makes Bitcoin deflationary, as there will be a finite amount of Bitcoin ever in circulation.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px !important; margin-right: 25px !important; "><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><i class="fa fa-bolt" style="font-size: px; color: rgb(31, 67, 226);"></i> DID YOU KNOW</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If we you were lucky enough to mine a singular Bitcoin block in 2009, the USD value of your reward today would be $1,850,000.</span></p>

    <p>The price of Bitcoin can be seen with the following graph:</p>
    <img src="images/btc_to_usd.png">
    <p style="margin-left: 15px !important; margin-right: 15px !important;">There have been many attempts to model the future prices of Bitcoin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;" class="" id="time-model">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;">Time Model</span><br>As it implies, the time model suggests that the price of Bitcoin depends on how long it has been along, i.e. suggesting that the level of adoption will grow as time goes on.
            The equation I found best for time modeling is:<br><span class="standout">Price = 0.003*(2010-currentYear)^7</span><br>
            <p>Although I did research this model extensively, I just did not find enough evidence to believe a model like this is as <span class="standout">useful</span> as the 2 below models.</p>
            
        </li>

        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;" class="mb-4 mt-4" id="stock-to-flow-model">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;">Stock to Flow</span><br>
            The stock to flow model is a model that can generate a scarcity ratio for commodities, i.e. gold, silver, etc. The higher the ratio, the more scarce the assets. This price model suggests that the price of Bitcoin goes up because there is a finite amount of Bitcoin that will ever be in circulation, which is 21,000,000. 
            <br>
            You can derive this with the Python code:<br>
            <div class="code-container">
                <pre >
                    <code class="language-python" >
def getTotalCirculation():
    initial_year = 2009
    reward_amount = 50
    total_bitcoin_in_circulation = 0
    for i in range(1, 200):
        if i % 4 == 0:
            total_bitcoin_in_circulation += reward_amount * 210000
            reward_amount = reward_amount / 2
            initial_year += 4
            print(f"In year {initial_year}, there will be {total_bitcoin_in_circulation:.3f} Bitcoin in circulation.")
getTotalCirculation()
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        The code above will spit out that by year year 2141, there will already by 20,999,999.999 Bitcoin in circulation, and will never exceed 21,000,000.<br>
        The stock to flow can be generated each year by dividing the total in circulation by the amount of Bitcoin that will come into circulation that year.<br>
        Using the data from the Yahoo CSV, we can visualize the basic relationship between stock and flow:<br>
        <img src="images/Stock to Flow Relation.png"><br>
        Further, we can also generate an estimated price using the stock to flow relationship via this formula created by me: <span class="standout">price=((stock/flow)^3)*0.4</span>
        <img src="images/S2F Price.png">
        <br>
        Please note, in the above, I also implemented a pre-processing smoothing algorithm to smooth the jumps between pricing data to ensure higher accuracy. Below, I show <span class="standout">Smoothing vs. No Smoothing vs. True Price</span>:
        <br>
        <img src="images/Bitcoin Yearly Averages compared to my models.png">
        <br>
        <p>As you can see, my model is actually pretty accurate until this year. Both the smoothed, and un-smoothed price generated prices near $77,000 even though the current price hovers around $37,000. My stock to flow model estimates Bitcoin to be priced at <span class="standout">$680,000</span> sometime in 2025 and 2026. Personally, I think the value is on the high side. Below, I use Logramithic Regression to come to, what I believe, is the most accurate price assessment of Bitcoin.</p>

    <h2>Bitcoin Price Model Limitations <span style="font-size: 20px; color: #7b7c7c">There are no good models, only some are useful</span></h2>
    <p>There are <span class="standout">a lot</span> of variables that go into creating a model like this. A lot of variables translates to limitations in models accuracy. I will list a few below...</p>
    <p>Examples of Model Limitations may happens because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Black Swan Event</span><br>
            <p>A Black Swan event is when some unforseeable [random] event occurs that no model can predict. For example, in May of 2021 Tesla announced that they would no longer be accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. This occured because the Tesla stock was dropping because they were being hypocritcal in the eyes of investors for promoting energy efficent technology, but allowing payment in Bitcoin, which is very in-effecient as we discussed earlier. Further, in 2021 China banned Bitcoin mining. 50% of the world&apos;s bitcoin mining power was generated in China before the crackdown, the global bitcoin economy felt the pain of China&apos;s bitcoin mining ban. </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 25px !important; margin-right: 25px !important; "><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><i class="fa fa-bolt" style="font-size: px; color: rgb(31, 67, 226);"></i> DID YOU KNOW</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The 2 events listed above caused the price of Bitcoin to plummit about $10,000.</span></p>

        </li>
        <li style="margin-left: 10px !important; margin-right: 10px !important;">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">GPU prices</span><br>
            <p>Since miners use very expensive computational devices to mine Bitcoin, the price of the hardware required to mine blocks can play a role. If the technology becomes cheaper, more people will start mining, and if the price rises, less people will want to begin mining. Luckity, the Bitcoin network can somewhat adjust for this price flucation per the real time difficulty algorithm discussed earlier.</p>

    <h2>What is Real Estate? <span style="font-size: 20px; color: #7b7c7c">Land vs. Real Estate</span></h2>
    <p>Real Estate in any land or property that has man-made features, or features that are permanently attached to it. Some real estate is more expensive than others, for example, waterfront properties have historically been more expensive to buy than traditional houses. </p>
    <p>The terms land and real estate  are often used interchangeably, but this is not correct...</p>
    <p><span class="standout">Land </span>is the physical earth that something is built on. There is a finite amount of land. Land includes the trees, rocks, rivers, oceans, streams, and anything else that can naturally consume space. Different types of land are found in various spots of the world. For example, a desert, where the primary component of the land is sand, may be harder to build and maintain human environments compared to a place which is comprised of trees, soil, and water.</p>
    <p><span class="standout">Real Estate </span>is the man-made changes that have been added to the land which bring value. For example, septic systems, apartments, houses, and water management systems are all changes that can be done to land to generate value. We call these changes improvements. Improvements to land are expensive, because you need to pay for the material, labor, etc. </p>
    <p>At the end of the day, real estate and the man-made changes to a section of land that can generate value, of which people can invest in.  </p>

<section class="container" id="real-estate-types">
    <h2>The different types of Real Estate <span style="font-size: 20px; color: #7b7c7c">Residential vs. Commercial vs. Industrial</span></h2>
    <p>There are 3 main categories of Real Estate, which are Residential, Commercial, and Industrial...</p>
    <p><span class="standout">Residential Real Estate </span>is the name most commonly associated with Real Estate - this is the Real Estate people live in. This can include houses, apartments, condos, town houses, etc. Residential Real Estate can be broken down into subcategories, which depend on the size of the property/housing unit. For example, there are single family homes, multi-family homes, and other unique type of living arrangements. Often times, the land or geographical area can incentive certain age ranges of people, which can translate to the types of homes. For example, mountainous and countryside properties often attract older people, or people with families. Suburban neighborhoods usually attract people who want, or people who have a family. And apartments / condos can attract younger, single people. </p>
    <p><span class="standout">Commercial Real Estate </span>is real estate needed by companies to carry out their business, and differs from Residential real estate because Commercial Real Estate investors assume no one will be living in their property [except for Commercial Real Estate like Hotels], rather only carrying out operations of business. For example, Commercial real estate includes shopping malls, grocery stores, parking lots, hospitals, college campuses, etc. </p>
    <p><span class="standout">Industrial Real Estate </span>is real estate that is used for factories, manufacturing, production, research, construction, transportation, data centers, etc. For example, this website is currently being served by a server located somewhere in San Francisco, California. This server is maintained by Digital Ocean in a giant data center. This Real Estate, AKA, the data center hosting this website, is considered to be Industrial Real Estate. Other examples may include yogurt factories, Amazon warehouses, Industrial Building, etc. </p>

    <h2>Price factors of Real Estate <span style="font-size: 20px; color: #7b7c7c">Internal vs. External</span></h2>
    <p>There are 3 main categories of Real Estate, which are Residential, Commercial, and Industrial...</p>
    <p>There are so many different factors that can determine the current value of a piece of Real Estate. I am going to break these into 2 main categories, internal and external factors. </p>
    <p><span class="standout">Internal factors </span>can include the age of the property, the condition of the property, the conditions of the improvements around the real estate [is the property operating on a septic system that was built 100 years ago?], the size of the property. </p>
    <p><span class="standout">External factors </span>include things outside of the property, such as the land surrounding the property [i.e. neighborhoods], crime rates, the price of labor, the price of electricity, the price of materials, the current state of the US economy, the current state of the US housing market, human population growth.</p>
    <p>This list is just scratching the surface, there are many more, but these are the main factors I thought were important noting.</p>

<section class="container" id="conclusions">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It is clear from the models above that both Bitcoin and Real Estate seem be an appreciating asset. The choice to invest comes down to a few aspects, such as risk tolerance, investment strategies, long term vs. short term, diversification strategies, and available liquidity.</p>
    <p>Based on the linear regression analysis on Real Estate, and the logramithic regression on Bitcoin, I think Real Estate is a much more safe bet. The reason being is because of predictability of price flucuations. The r^2 value for the Bitcoin analysis was something near 60%, while the Real Estate r^2 value was 96%. As an investor, I like the 96% because it offers me a safer return on investment. However, I am not discarding Bitcoin. I think a wise investor is one who diversifies him/herself to optimize their return on investment in different markets and niches.</p>
    <p>Personally, I would expose about 20% of my portfolio to cryptocurrencies in general. It'd be an educated investment to make gains based on the cyclical trends cryptocurrencies seem to follow, but it wouldn't be enough to tremendously damage my portfolio if some unforseeable event occurs, such as discussed in <a href="#model-limitations">Bitcoin Price Model limitations</a>.</p>
    <p>Overall, I'd continue to follow to 80/20 principle, where I invest 80% of my portfolio into safe assets, such as Real Estate, Mutual Funds, Bonds, and save the other 20% for more volitile assets, such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and option trading.</p>
